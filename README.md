# Billy boy

In future he can be really good automation tool for paying bills and letting you know how much it left to pay for bills and etc.

For now he can just:
* run in background and notify you some useful information

And of course now it's not a bad example of using Request and BS4.

How to run:
* You should know your `userarea.magticom.ge` account and telasi id.
* Second you should edit `Main_Billy.py` for values that I mentioned above.
* That's it you can run `Main_Billy.py` and have fun.
